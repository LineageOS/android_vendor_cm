      "message": "Hey, why does Tmobile has the conflicting MCC(262) and MNC(09) with vodafone? Do you have any idea about this?\n\nAlso I was having a look at \"vendor/qcom/proprietary/common/etc/apns-conf.xml\" file in the feijao build on my system. Even this file from qualcomm doesn\u0027t include 04 and 09 MNC corresponding to 262 MCC. So I guess we can remove 04 and 09 if they are absolutely not required.",
